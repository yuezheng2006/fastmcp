# FastMCP Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

FastMCP is a robust TypeScript framework built to simplify the creation and management of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. These servers allow client applications to interact seamlessly with large language models (LLMs) by managing sessions, handling authentication, and exposing executable functions (tools) for various tasks. The framework aims to provide a smooth development experience by integrating schema validation, error handling, real-time updates, and a convenient command-line interface for testing and debugging.

The project is being built to reduce the complexity of setting up servers that collaborate with LLMs. It targets developers who need to quickly create and deploy MCP-based applications without spending excessive time on boilerplate code. Success for FastMCP will be measured by its ease of use, robust error management, reliable session handling, and ability to support real-time communications via Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Implementing the core framework in TypeScript.
*   Providing methods to add and manage tools, resources, and prompt templates.
*   Integration of schema validation libraries such as Zod, ArkType, and Valibot.
*   Establishing client session management with dedicated FastMCPSession objects.
*   Enabling real-time communication via Server-Sent Events (SSE) with automated pings and progress notifications.
*   Supporting authentication using a custom authentication function.
*   Implementing logging, error handling, and progress reporting in tools.
*   Providing a CLI with commands like `fastmcp dev` for testing and `fastmcp inspect` for a web UI-based inspection.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Extensive frontend interfaces – the built-in web UI will only be used for server inspection.
*   Advanced analytics or monitoring dashboards beyond basic logging and inspection.
*   Integrating third-party payment or subscription services.
*   Mobile or native desktop app integrations.
*   Deployment orchestration – focus remains on establishing the framework and local testing capabilities.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user starts by initializing the FastMCP server with a given name, version, and an optional custom authentication function. Once the server is initialized, the user configures it by adding tools, resources, and prompt templates through dedicated methods like `addTool`, `addResource`, and `addPrompt`. Following configuration, the server is started using either a stdio or SSE transport mode, preparing it to listen for client connections.

When a client connects using the specified SSE endpoint, a new session is established to handle the connection. The user (or client developer) can now make various requests such as listing available tools, executing a specific tool, or retrieving resource content. The server processes these requests with schema validation and proper error handling, sending real-time updates back to the client via SSE. After the client interaction is complete, disconnect events are handled and the session is cleaned up before the server eventually stops when commanded.

## 4. Core Features

    *   Expose various data types (file contents, images, logs) to clients via unique URIs.
    *   Support storing and retrieving both text and binary data.
    *   Enable the creation of resource templates for parameterized data retrieval.

*   **Prompt Management:**

    *   Define reusable and configurable prompt templates.
    *   Support argument auto-completion and enumerated options for prompt parameters.

*   **Authentication:**

    *   Include a custom authentication function to verify and manage client access.
    *   Populate session objects with user-specific information post-authentication.

*   **Session Management:**

    *   Create and manage dedicated FastMCPSession objects for each client connection.
    *   Provide events for client connect and disconnect.
    *   Allow configuration of session-related properties like logging levels and capabilities.

*   **Real-Time Communication:**

    *   Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for pushing real-time updates and notifications.
    *   Implement automatic SSE pings to maintain connection reliability.

*   **CLI Tools:**

    *   `fastmcp dev` for command line testing and debugging.
    *   `fastmcp inspect` for a web-based UI to inspect and monitor server operations.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend/Client-Related:**

    *   SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time notifications.
    *   Basic web UI for `fastmcp inspect` to view server state and logs.

*   **Backend:**

    *   TypeScript as the primary programming language.

    *   Core packages include:

        *   `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
        *   `@standard-schema/spec`
        *   `execa` for process management.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   Real-time updates should be delivered with minimal latency over SSE.
    *   Tools should process and return responses within an acceptable range to maintain interactive usage.

*   **Security:**

    *   Strict authentication protocols must be in place to control access to server resources.
    *   Data transmitted via SSE must use HTTPS to ensure secure communication.
    *   Input parameters should be properly validated against schemas to prevent injection attacks.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   The framework should safely handle both text and binary data.
    *   Maintain clear logging and error handling for auditing purposes.

*   **Usability:**

    *   The server and CLI commands should be user-friendly, with clear error messages and progress notifications.
    *   Documentation must provide detailed examples of configuration and usage.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The implementation relies on TypeScript and its ecosystem; therefore, users must be familiar with TypeScript development.
    *   Availability of optional libraries like Valibot and ArkType is subject to user preference; the primary mechanism is via Zod.
    *   Real-time communication is reliant on SSE; environments that do not support SSE may require alternate transport mechanisms.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   It is assumed that users have basic familiarity with MCP concepts and large language models.
    *   Clients connecting to the server are expected to handle SSE appropriately.
    *   The environment must support Node.js and relevant TypeScript libraries for server-side execution.
    *   Testing is largely performed locally with the assumption of eventual deployment in a secure, HTTPS-based environment.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Technical Hurdles:**

    *   Handling simultaneous SSE connections could lead to performance bottlenecks if not properly managed.
    *   Schema validations might become complex when mixing multiple libraries (Zod, ArkType, Valibot); ensuring consistency is key.
    *   Real-time error handling and logging require careful orchestration to maintain clarity and prevent data overload.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**

    *   Implement robust rate limiting and session management to prevent performance issues with numerous concurrent SSE connections.
    *   Standardize schema definitions and validations across tools to minimize discrepancies.
    *   Use modular logging mechanisms so that debugging and tracking are decoupled from the main application flow.
    *   Regularly test both the CLI tools and web UI to catch discrepancies early in the development process.
