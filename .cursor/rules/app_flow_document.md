# FastMCP App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new user first hears about FastMCP, they are introduced to the service through a clean landing page that explains the purpose of the framework in simple language. The landing page provides a clear call-to-action that invites users to create an account. When a user clicks on the sign-up option, they are taken to a simple registration page where they can fill in details such as their name, email, and password. For users who prefer alternative methods, there is an option to sign up using social login approaches that connect with trusted providers. After the registration is completed, the user receives a confirmation email to verify their account. In the same area, there is also an option for users who already have an account to sign in. The login interface accepts email and password inputs with a clear link to initiate password recovery. If the user forgets their password, the system guides them through a secure reset process by asking for the registered email address and then sending a reset link via email.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After a successful login, the user is directed to the main dashboard which provides an overview of the FastMCP server’s current state. The dashboard is designed with clarity in mind and includes distinct sections that are immediately visible. At the top, a header displays the server name, version, and quick access icons for notifications and settings. Alongside, a sidebar presents navigation options that allow users to move between the different modules such as Tools, Resources, Prompts, and Session Information. The dashboard also features widgets that present live logs, real-time progress updates from Server-Sent Events (SSE), and an overview of active client sessions. By clicking on any of the navigation options, users can dive deeper into the corresponding section and manage functionalities directly from the dashboard.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The core of FastMCP lies in its seamless feature transitions. Once on the dashboard, users can select the Tools section where they are presented with a list of available executable functions. When a user clicks on a specific tool, a detailed interface appears showing the tool’s schema, any required parameters, and an area to input execution arguments. On submission, the tool validates the input using standard schema libraries such as Zod, ArkType, or Valibot. The process then moves into execution and the result is displayed on the same page along with progress updates and log messages. Similarly, in the Resources section, users see a list of unique URIs that point to files, images, or logs stored on the server. When a resource is selected, the page displays the resource content – which can be in text or binary form – as well as options to download or preview the file. The Prompts module works in a similar way; it offers a list of reusable prompt templates that users can click on to get additional guidelines, autocompletion suggestions, and parameter outlines needed for LLM interactions. Each of these sections smoothly transitions back to the main dashboard when work is done, ensuring that any changes or new executions are always reflected in real-time via SSE updates. There is also an advanced CLI interface for developers, which is accessed through a special inspection page. This page is integrated into the web app and provides direct access to commands such as 'fastmcp dev' for testing and debugging purposes, offering a clear view of server events and session analytics.

## Settings and Account Management

Within the settings page, users can manage their personal profile and adjust application preferences. This page is designed to be straightforward, enabling users to update their account details such as email and password. There is an option to change notification settings, manage API keys for session authentication, and configure SSE preferences for live updates. For users who are using the command line tools in parallel, the settings page also provides links to documentation that explains how the CLI commands interact with the server. This section not only addresses personal configurations but also includes advanced settings for those who need to change server-level parameters like logging levels or root configurations for client sessions. After making changes, the user can easily save and return to the main dashboard with a confirmation message indicating that the settings have been updated successfully.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is built to handle errors gracefully. If a user enters incorrect information on the sign-in page or attempts to access a feature without proper authentication, they are promptly shown a clear error message that explains the issue. These error messages are designed in everyday language, ensuring that the user knows whether it was a validation error or a connectivity problem. Similarly, if a tool or resource fails during execution due to invalid parameters or a processing issue, the system displays an in-context error message along with suggestions on how to correct the issue. In cases where connectivity with the server is lost, the interface displays a fallback screen indicating the loss of connection and offers the chance to reconnect once the status changes. For administrators or advanced users, alternate paths exist such as a specialized log inspection page that provides detailed reports and error traces, which can be used for debugging and recovery purposes. Regardless of the error, every message and page is designed to help the user quickly regain the normal flow of operation.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey within FastMCP is structured to provide a smooth, interconnected experience from the moment a new user signs up until everyday server management tasks are performed. Beginning at a welcoming landing and registration page, users are introduced to a robust authentication process that ensures secure access. Once logged in, the main dashboard serves as the central hub from which all key functions such as tool execution, resource management, and prompt customization can be accessed. Throughout every step, users experience clear transitions between actions thanks to well-defined pages for each module, along with real-time updates delivered through SSE. Settings and account management capabilities provide the flexibility to personalize the experience, while built-in error handling ensures that any obstacles are managed with clarity and direction. The FastMCP journey is designed to be intuitive and comprehensive, ensuring that every interaction – whether through the web interface or the integrated CLI tools – builds towards a stable and responsive environment for managing MCP servers and interacting with large language models.
